BessyHDFViewer
==============

BessyHDFViewer is a data visualization software for the data files generated by the [eveCSS](https://github.com/eveCSS) data recording software.
[eveCSS](https://github.com/eveCSS) is developed by the [working group 7.25](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt7/fb-72/ag-725.html) of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and used by departments [7.1](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt7/fb-71.html) and [7.2](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt7/fb-72.html) at the [synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/forschung/quellen/bessy/index_en.html) in Berlin to record all measurement data in a consistent data format. 

With BessyHDFViewer you can:
* Browse a directory of measurement files and quickly get an overview what is contained
* Plot arbitrary columns of the data files into 2D line graphs
* Perform some basic computation (algebra on arbitrary columns, peak finding, numerical derivative, dataset normalization)
* Export plots and data as PDF graphs and ASCII files
* Find differences between similar measurements
* Search data files containing keywords or given data ranges
* In addition to HDF5 files from eveCSS, plot whitespace-separated ASCII files and the older HDF4 format of PTB 

BessyHDFViewer is written in [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) and can be extended by plugins written either in Tcl, or as independent programs in other languages, such as [Python](https://www.python.org/).
